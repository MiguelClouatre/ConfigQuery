Hello potential employers, 

I created this after spending a couple months at my service desk job wishing I had something to facilitate my workflow. Originally, its only purpose was to help me have quick access to necessary troubleshooting steps, admin passwords,
and standard operating procedures (SOPs). I made a window where I could create and organize different conversations with ChatGPT using OpenAI's API. Currently I can upload Word documents, .txt files, PDFs, and excel documents to 
this program, and the program stores them in a vector database. I chose to use ChromaDB as it was free, open soure, and more than sufficient for my needs. LLMs are particularly good at searching through vector databases, so I can ask 
through the chatbox I created for whatever info I need, and the program runs through all the documentation I've uploaded and provides the relevant info in seconds. 

This is already useful for me, but now my wife has been using it as well to help her write some of the more complex SQL queries she has to write for work. Right now, I just have it running off OpenAI's API using tokens I've purchased from 
their site. However, in the future I would like to invest in a computer that can run an LLM so I can run the whole program locally here at home instead of pinging an outside source like OpenAI API for all my requests. This would be more secure
if I ever need my program for something sensitive, but also would allow me to minimize my costs over time. 

If you would like any more information about it, feel free to ask me during an interview. I find this work interesting, and I think I'll continue to iterate on this idea to make it even more useful for myself and potentially even make it 
polished enough to use in the workplace. This is just the beginning of my journey in software development, and although software development may not be my career path, I think creating custom applications to facilitate my career will be 
something I continue to do going forward. 

Thanks,
Miguel Clouatre
